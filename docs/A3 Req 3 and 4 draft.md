REQ 3: Day/Night System

At the start of the game, the TimeTracker is set to DAY.

As the game progresses, TimeTracker advances time and alternates between DAY and
NIGHT.

At night:

● MerchantMob appears on the map, offering items at discounted prices (but has a 50%
chance to scam the player and runaway).

uses it, it increases the farmer’s maximum HP.
